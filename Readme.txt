- image_similarity_AE/ImageSimilarity.ipynb
Contains code to train ResNet-34 model dataset and preprocessing before training. Also contains code to get image embedding and create Locality-sensitive hashing.

- image_similarity_AE/find_similar_image.py
To find similar images from Caltech101 dataset based on any given Image on the internet.
It uses a re-trained image recognition model and LSH tables created in ImageSimilarity.ipynb 

- find_similar_image_TransferLearning
Similar Image Retrieval using Autoencoders, kNN and t-SNE
